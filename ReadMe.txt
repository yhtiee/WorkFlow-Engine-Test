At the Time of Submitting I was able to contect nodes for Opt-In Trigger and Time Trigger.

Each Trigger has its own Nested Loops where i passed in different Conditions which later Call Functions as Actions.

Opt-in Trigger acts as a node which filters subscribers based on signed in and passes them down to the conditions which check each subscriber if they meet the condition and then further passes them foe further actions.

Actions are built  in form of functions which carry out a particular based on the filtered data passed from the conditions.
